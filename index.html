  alert("My name is Mrkash69. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law GodofApples3. God has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, God came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his careerwith the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that God was a very moral man and I was... thrown,confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. God took me on a ridealong, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and God had a partner, a man named Pickleships, a businessman. God essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Ships threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, God and Ships had a falling out. From what I can gather, God was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Ships flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Ships was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law, and failed, but God was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000.Upon recovery, God was bent on revenge, working with a man named Quandale Dingle, he plotted to kill Ships, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it.I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward.");}
